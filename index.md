# About

I am currently a Research Associate at the [Development Data Lab (DDL)](https://www.devdatalab.org/). Prior to joining DDL, I was a Predoctoral Fellow in Economics at Yale Universityâ€™s [Tobin Center for Economic Policy](https://tobin.yale.edu/). I received my MSc Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science.

# Research Interests

"I like dense cities best and care about them most". <sup>1</sup> I am an urban and labor economist, interestd in  housing affordability in cities and making cities more efficient labor markets. 

In developed settings, I want to better understand how land-use regulations impact residential sorting and the aggregate effects on labor market efficiency and quality of matches. Specifically, I am interesting in quantifying potential losses in agglomeration effects caused caused by the lack of housing supply in highly-productive cities. 

The second part of my urban economics research agenda is centered around designing policies to help developing cities best respond to rapidly increasing urban populations. I am interested in creating a framework to analyze tradeoffs between redevelopment and slum upgrading, focusing on the residents' labor market outcomes.
