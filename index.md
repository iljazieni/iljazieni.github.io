# About

I am an incoming Economics PhD student at [UPenn Wharton](https://doctoral.wharton.upenn.edu/programs-of-study/applied-economics/). I am currently a Research Associate at the [Development Data Lab (DDL)](https://www.devdatalab.org/). Prior to joining DDL, I was a Predoctoral Fellow in Economics at Yale Universityâ€™s [Tobin Center for Economic Policy](https://tobin.yale.edu/). I received my MSc Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science.

# Research Interests

"I like dense cities best and care about them most". <sup>1</sup> 

I am an urban and labor economist, interested in improving housing affordability and making cities more efficient labor markets. 

In the context of developed cities, I want to better understand how land-use regulations impact residential sorting and their aggregate effects on labor market efficiency and quality of matches. Specifically, I am interested in quantifying potential losses in agglomeration effects caused by insufficient housing supply in highly-productive cities. 

The second part of my urban economics research agenda is centered around designing policies to help developing cities best respond to rapidly increasing urban populations. I am interested in creating a framework through which to analyze tradeoffs between redevelopment and slum upgrading, focusing on residents' labor market outcomes.
