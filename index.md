# About

I am an Economics PhD student at [UPenn Wharton](https://doctoral.wharton.upenn.edu/programs-of-study/applied-economics/). Prior to joining Wharton, I was a Research Associate at the [Development Data Lab (DDL)](https://www.devdatalab.org/) and a Predoctoral Fellow in Economics at Yale Universityâ€™s [Tobin Center for Economic Policy](https://tobin.yale.edu/). I received my MSc Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science.

# Research Interests

"I like dense cities best and care about them most". <sup>1</sup> 

How can developing cities best respond to rapidly increasing urban populations? I am an urban and labor economist, interested in improving access to adequate housing in developing cities and making them more efficient labor markets. Specifically, I am interested in improving our understanding of the tradeoffs between redevelopment and slum upgrading, focusing on residents' labor market outcomes.
